# MECHACAR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

## **Linear Regression to Predict MPG**

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	* 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	*
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
